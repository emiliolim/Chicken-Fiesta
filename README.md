# Chicken-Fiesta
One of the first games I've coded, which was developed during my junior year of highschool and finished in three days.
This game was specifically made in Eclipse 2012-3 Edition but should work for any compiler that handles Java.

## Getting the code to work
1) Unzip the folder 
2) The main startup .java folder can be found as follows:

   **Chicken Fiesta >> Option 3 >> src >> com >> game >> src >> main >> Game.java**

**Running Game.java should be enough to start the program**

For any troubleshooting/help please feel free to shoot me at: emilioarislim@gmail.com

## Controls
Press WASD if you want to go up, left, down, or right in that order

Click the spacebar to shoot eggs and delete chickens

## Reflection
By all means, this is the base product for what I originally sought out. In the future, I would prefer the game to be less choppy and for the chickens to move in random directions. 

For now, the game is very similar to Atari Space Invaders and I'm happy with it. One of these days though, I would love to redo the whole thing with the knowledge I have now about developing games and making everything run easier.
